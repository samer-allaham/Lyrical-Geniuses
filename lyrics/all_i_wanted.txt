The virtual is going in the way
Keep it tight so no-one will stray
Staring at a light needless to say
That I will be alright, alright home
And your tears sting, friend
You have waited the end out there
Golden hour finding
You stand still, stare at my stupid bedroom
All that I wanted wasn't unwanted
Oh and I wonder why I'm not wanted
All that I wanted was not there
But I dared
Be wanted
Yeah, in a corridor
Yeah, and you call me
Yeah, when I see you
You, you know damn well
Throw back arms I love you
And I won't be bothering with mourning
It's crucial that you see the truth
When looking for yourself
Not useless observations
Yeah, in a corridor
Yeah, and you call me
Yeah, when I see you
You, you know damn well
