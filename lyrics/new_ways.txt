Washed out brain
I have a dirty mind
Oh, I need, I need new ways
To waste my time
I need new ways

Washed out brain
I live alone, alone, alone
Washed out face
Keep me inside

I need new ways to waste my time
I need, I need new ways

I’m trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not just cross myself out
Not just disappear
I’ve been trying to stay out
But there’s something in you
I can’t be without
I just need it here
Oh I need
New ways to waste my time
I need new ways
To waste my time
I need new ways
To waste my time

I’m trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not to cross myself out
Not to disappear
I’ve been trying to stay out
But there's something in you
I can't be without
I just need it here

(I just need it here)
(I need new ways to waste my time)
(I need new ways to waste my time)
(I need new ways to waste my time)
(I need new ways to waste my time)
