Meet me where all wrongs turn to right
Meet me where the light greets dark
Where the lovers go when they are tired

Keep me where you hide your second sight
Deep inside where secrets start
Where the lovers go when they are tired

Let’s watch the last rays fading out
Entwine our bodies on common ground

Will you hold on my love?
Even in a time of trouble
I want to hold on my love
Even in times of trouble
Will you hold on my love?
Even in a time of trouble
I want to hold on my love
Even in times of trouble

Meet me where you can break the silence
Meet me where the light greets dark
Where the lovers go when they are tired
Meet me in the gentle afterlight
Where your world falls apart
Where do lovers go when they are tired?

Let’s watch the last rays fading out
Entwine our bodies on common ground

Will you hold on my love?
Even in a time of trouble
I want to hold on my love
Even in times of trouble
Will you hold on my love?
Even in a time of trouble
I want to hold on my love
Even in times of trouble
