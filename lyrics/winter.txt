Drifting apart like two sheets of ice, my love
Frozen hearts growing colder with time
There's no heat from our mouths
Please take me back to when I was yours
And we were in flames, I needed, I needed you
To run through my veins, like disease, disease
And now we are strange, strangers
(I need you... I need you...)
It's different now, gray faced, eyes burnt out
Flames are gone, my gloves are out
I have a feeling love's gone mad
We're too similar, losing our minds
With cabin fever, shut in confined spaces
Lost in the dark, my hand taken, rested on your heart
And we were in flames, I needed, I needed you (Rested on your heart)
To run through my veins, like disease, disease (Rested on your heart)
And now we are strange, strangers (Rested on your heart)
Wait for me to degrade before
You go killing prey for waste of
Daylight speaks when
Slumber's keeping under the bed
Out of revenge, I'm derailing
While you've been staining our sheets
With some piece of me
With some piece of me
Oh, winter comes
Oh, winter crush all of the things that I once loved
Winter come
Winter crush all of the things that I once had
