I feel tears wellin' up
Cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say that I was takin' it hard
Oh, she wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl

Well, the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
