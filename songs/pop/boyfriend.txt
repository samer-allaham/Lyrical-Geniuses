I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut
But I get cut again and again
I want a boyfriend

Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones
But I want love again and again
I want a boyfriend

I been up all night
Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why (Ah)
I've been doing just fine
But baby, that don't mean
That I'm feeling anti you and me

There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights, I just want more than me
