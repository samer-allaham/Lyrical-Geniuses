It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller at night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike

You know it's thriller
Thriller at night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller at night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
