Yeah, yeah, yeah

Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love

I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love

Look, I love it when they count me out, I'm a soldier (I'm a soldier)
Love when they think I ain't cool 'cause I'm sober ('Cause I'm sober)
You used to love when we was down, we was closer (Yeah, yeah)
But I stopped lovin' ever since I got fucked over
Hoe, don't call me, I don't know ya

You gotta keep that same energy (Energy)
I'm not no regular entity (Woo)
I'm not your friend, I'm your enemy (Enemy)
I don't know what's gotten into me
Lately, I'm just feeling finicky
Lately, I just want the cake and the greatest amenities
Lately, I ain't got no sympathy, aim at the industry
This ain't the way that they pictured me, what's your identity?
