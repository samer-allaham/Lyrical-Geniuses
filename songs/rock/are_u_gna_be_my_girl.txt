Go

So one, two, three, take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine that I really wanna make you mine
I say you look so fine that I really wanna make you mine

Oh, four, five, six, c'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need the money
When you look like that do you honey

Big black boots
Long brown hair
She's so sweet with her
Get back stare

Well I could see
You home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
I know we ain't got much to say
